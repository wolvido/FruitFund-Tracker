# FruitFund Tracker
FruitFund Tracker is a web app designed to help informal groups manage their shared finances and achieve collective goals. It simplifies monthly contribution tracking, loan approvals, and repayments while providing a clear, calendar-based overview of progress. With tools for goal tracking and financial management, it ensures transparency, accountability, and smooth collaboration within the group.

## Purpose
What started as a small group of women, including my mother, where each member payed a fixed monthly contribution. At the end of the year, the pooled money would be used to buy 12 kinds of fruits in bulk and distributed for each member to celebrate the Filipino New Year tradition of having 12 fruits for new year.  
Over time, the group grew, and they began using the money not only for the fruits but also to offer loans to members or trusted individuals in need.  

Aside for buying fruits, the system eventually adapted to support various community needs, from shared projects to community support and saving together.

This system inspired the creation of FruitFund Tracker, a tool designed to help informal groups like this easily manage and track their monthly contributions, loans, and savings goals. The name "FruitFund" is an ode to its original purpose.
